# ECE636_InformationTheory_DeepLearning
The code in this repo builds a simple CNN in tensorflow and tries to reproduce the result in the paper "Modeling Information Flow Through Deep Neural Networks", in which the author uses conditional entropy to model the information in the convolutional layer in CNN.. The settings are a little different from the original paper, but the main idea is maintained.
